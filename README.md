Lightweight Django app that I built for the Tech Lady Hackathon pre-party in October 2017.

Uses [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to receive text messages and send them to the Django server for processing.

This is a remix of a [Django app I built in January 2015 for the Digital Resolutions party](https://github.com/shannonturner/digital-resolution).

Here's a [slideshow that will guide you through installing and running Digital Resolutions on your computer](https://github.com/hearmecode/slides/blob/master/Workshop%20Web%20Dev/Hear%20Me%20Code%20-%20Intro%20Web%20Dev.pdf). It's just a little different -- Digital Resolutions was built in 2015 and uses Django 1.7 (and the setup guide reflects that). This repository uses Django 1.11, which can be a little easier to set up and get running.
